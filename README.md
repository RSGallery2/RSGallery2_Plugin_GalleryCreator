# RSGallery2_Plugin_GalleryCreator
RSGallery2 plugin to automatically create a personal gallery for each new user that is created.

When a new user registers, this plugin (when enabled) will create a new RSGallery2 gallery for that new user and owned by that new user, based on the settings in the plugin parameters

When my galleries is activated in the RSGallery2 configuration then the user owned galleries will be shown on the site.

The user needs permissions
* 'edit own' and
* 'edit 'state own'
* 'delete own',
* ('create own'),
to upload/release and delete images in owned gallery.

'Create own' allows to add more galleries to the owned ones.  
For web pages which support my galleries. With this plugin a new gallery may be created for every new Joomla user

Install the plugin, *enable the plugin*, check the plugin settings and add
a new user (try from frontend and backend).
